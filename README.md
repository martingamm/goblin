A collection of common unix userland commands written in Go.

Loosely based on http://tools.suckless.org/9base.

This is an educational endeavour both in learning Go better and learning
the utilities we use every day better.

#### Currently available utils (some may be fairly minimal):
 * cat
 * echo
 * sleep
 * seq
 * uniq

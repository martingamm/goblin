A collection of unix userland commands written in Go.

Based on http://tools.suckless.org/9base, GNU Coreutils and our own
imagination.

This is an educational endeavour both in learning Go better and learning
the utilities we use every day better.

#### Currently available utils (some may be fairly minimal):
 * cat
 * echo
 * seq
 * sleep
 * uniq
 * webtail
